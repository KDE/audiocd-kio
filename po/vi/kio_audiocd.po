"Unknown error.  If you have a cd in the drive try running cdparanoia -vsQ as "
"yourself (not root). Do you see a track list? If not, make sure you have "

"probably /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1, etc.. If it still does not work, try typing "
"audiocd:/?device=/dev/sg0 (or similar) to tell kio_audiocd which device your "
